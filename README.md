# Oasis Infobyte (OIBSIP) Internship Tasks Repository

Welcome to the **OIBSIB Internship Tasks Repository**, a collection of data science and machine learning projects completed as part of the internship program with **Oasis Infobyte**. This repository showcases various tasks assigned during the internship, each focusing on different real-world challenges and their solutions using Python.

## Repository Contents

### 1. **Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification**
**File**: `Iris Flower Classification.ipynb`  
**Description**:  
This project aims to classify iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. Using the classic Iris dataset, the task demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning techniques.

**Process**:
- Loaded and visualized the Iris dataset.
- Performed data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Built a classification model using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 2. **Task 2 - Unemployment Analysis**
**File**: `Unemployment Analysis.ipynb`  
**Description**:  
This project explores the issue of unemployment by analyzing relevant datasets to uncover patterns and trends. The task focuses on data visualization and statistical analysis to derive actionable insights.

**Process**:
- Imported and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends over time.
- Created visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Highlighted key factors contributing to unemployment.

### 3. **Task 3 - Car Price Prediction**
**File**: `Car Price Prediction.ipynb`  
**Description**:  
This task involves building a predictive model to estimate the price of a car based on its features (e.g., mileage, year, fuel type). The project demonstrates the use of regression models for accurate predictions.

**Process**:
- Preprocessed the dataset by encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric features.
- Explored the data to understand correlations between features and car prices.
- Trained regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

### 4. **Task 4 - Email Spam Detection**
**File**: `Email Spam Detection.ipynb`  
**Description**:  
This project tackles the problem of identifying spam emails using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a classifier that accurately distinguishes between spam and ham emails.

**Process**:
- Loaded and cleaned the email dataset to remove special characters and unnecessary information.
- Vectorized the text data using techniques such as Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF.
- Trained a Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection.
- Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualized evaluation metrics including a confusion matrix and precision-recall curve.
